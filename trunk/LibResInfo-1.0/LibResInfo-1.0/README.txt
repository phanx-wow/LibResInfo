LibResInfo-1.0
=================

Library to provide information about resurrections cast in your group.

LibResInfo detects resurrection spell casts and identifies who they are
being cast on, and provides that information to addons through callbacks
and API functions. It also supports Mass Resurrection and Soulstone.

LibResInfo was written to replace LibResComm. It works locally without
the need for addon communication, so it is not necessary for anyone else
in your group to have it installed.

Requires [LibStub] [1] and [CallbackHandler-1.0] [2].
