Description
-----------

LibResInfo detects resurrection spell casts and identifies who they are
being cast on, and provides that information to addons through callbacks
and API functions.

LibResInfo was written to replace LibResComm. It works locally without
the need for addon communication, so it is not necessary for anyone else
in your group to have it installed.

Requires LibStub and CallbackHandler-1.0.


API Documentation
-----------------

Information about the callbacks and functions LibResInfo provides are
available on the CurseForge project page:
